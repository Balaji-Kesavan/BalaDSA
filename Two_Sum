"""
Two Sum (HashMap approach)
What it is:
Given an array and a target sum, find two numbers that add up to the target.
Brute force: O(n²) by checking all pairs.
HashMap approach: Store seen numbers in a dictionary → O(n).
Interview Tips:
Always clarify if only one pair exists or multiple.
Ask if array is sorted (binary search + two pointers works).
Be ready to extend to 3Sum / 4Sum variants.
